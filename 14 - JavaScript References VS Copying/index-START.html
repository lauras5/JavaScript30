    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    teams[3] = 'Lux'
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // it always goes back to the reference, original array
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const teams4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // will take all players and spread them into new array
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes', 
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // clone deep to go into twitter/facebook, only goes one layer deep

    //poor mans deep clone
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    // will turn obj into a string, then immediately parse it back to an obj
